Task:
Write a whack-a-mole game.
 
Description:
Whack-a-mole is a standard carnival/arcade game where, on a set interval, a number of moles would pop out of their holes, and you have to hit them on the head with a mallet attempting to hit as many as you can before time runs out.
 
What I'd like for you to do is create a simulated version of this using javascript.  There should be a grid of 'holes' that every few seconds a set number of 'moles' will show up in random positions.  The user has to click on the 'mole' to simulate whacking it, which should add 1 to their score.  After a certain number of rounds, report the users score to them.  Feel free to represent the holes and the moles however you'd like.
 
You're welcome to use whatever libraries you'd like. I'd like you to utilize the following technologies:

Object oriented JavaScript
Event delegation to handle user actions
Utilizing closures to control variable scope
Feel free to take as much time as you'd like to complete the assignment and come up with something you are happy with. It helps if you write about how you approached the assignment, and why you made the choices you did. Feel free to do this as inline comments or as a README.

Thanks!
